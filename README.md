- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @guitorr
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m an Electrical Engineering student interested in developing wacky contraptions that makes daily life a more straightforward task.
- The project I'm currently working on is an automation system for my bedroom that uses 3 Kinect v1 sensors to control multiple things like lighting, a sound system and a couple of smart appliances.
- If you have any suggestions, I'm here to listen and learn!
